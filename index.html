            My name is Konstantin Ivaylov Marinov. I was born in Sofia, Bulagaria on May 3rd, 1992. I will be 24 years
            old this year. I have a younger sister named Anna. When I was three years old my father, Ivaylo, came to
            America. My mother, Irina, moved to America the year after. My sister and I were taken care of by our
            grandparents until we were able to come to America ourselves. In October of 1999 my sister and I were on a
            plane for the first time in our lives on our way to be reunited with our parents. From 1999 to 2006 we
            lived at 7520 North Claremont in Rogers Park. The building was owned by friends' of my parents who they
            knew from Bulgaria. I started first grade at George B. Armstrong. I attended that school until half way
            through seventh grade. My closest group of friends, who I still see frequently to this day, were made in
            those seven years. My family moved to Buffalo Grove because my parents wanted a better education for my
            sister and I. I finished off my second half of seventh grade and eighth grade at Cooper Middle School. From
            there, I went to Buffalo Grove High School for then next four years. In thinking about my future at the
            time, I wanted to be a plastic surgeon. However, that was quickly crossed off the list when I took biology
            and chemistry classes. My father owns a construction company and I worked with him several summers during
            high school and that is when I decided that I wanted to pursue architecture as my major at IIT. The summer
            before starting college was the first time I went back to Bulgaria since I had moved to America. My parents
            to this day have not been back yet.
